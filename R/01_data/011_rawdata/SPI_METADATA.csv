This dimension aims to assess whether national statistical systems have the necessary capacity to adopt and comply with international statistical standards. "
SPI.D2.CS,SPI Dimension 2: Censuses and Surveys (CS),Average of Dimension 2 Indicators,World Bank,"Data collection is the key responsibility of national statistical systems where information on a nation’s population, economy, health and other aspects are recorded in an accurate and timely manner. Through censuses and surveys, sometimes together with administrative systems, the NSSs collect data and generate aggregate indicators based on the results. This dimension aims to check the availability and frequency of key censuses and inter-census surveys. The required frequencies of censuses and surveys are established based on international recommendations. In some cases, criteria are adjusted to avoid unnecessarily punishing the least developed countries where there is huge disparities among country practices. For example, with labor force survey and establishment survey, the SPI loosened the criteria compared to the international recommendation. 
This dimension covers 8 indicators on population and housing census, agricultural census, business census, income and expenditure surveys and other surveys on agriculture, health, labor force and establishments.
"
SPI.D3.AKI,SPI Dimension 3: Availability of Key Indicators (AKI),Average of Dimension 3 Indicators,World Bank,"Transforming source data into statistical outputs (indicators) and releasing them on a timely basis shows that the statistical systems are utilizing their capacity in data production. Reporting relevant data to specialized international agencies on time and getting them published in their respective databases demonstrates that statistical systems meet required quality standards and timeliness. Therefore, this dimension evaluates national statistical systems by reviewing the availability of country data for the most recent year in international databases. By looking at the data availability in international databases, it also makes the assessment cost-effective."
SPI.D4.DPO,SPI Dimension 4: Dissemination Practices & Openness (DPO),Average of Dimension 4 Indicators,World Bank,"Data users are seen as an integral part of the national statistical system, which is crucial to the improvement of collection, processing and dissemination of quality data. Therefore, dissemination practices of statistical systems reflect an important part of the overall statistical capacity. This dimension is built on the principle that quality statistics should be delivered to the public in a timely, easily accessible manner for free. It includes 10 indicators under two sub-sections: Dissemination capacity of NSO and Openness of Data."
SPI.OVRL.SCR,Statistical Performance Index: Overall Score,"Average of SPI Dimension 1, 2, 3, and 4",World Bank,"The concept adopted here views the statistical capacity of an NSS in terms of its range of products, and the processes it uses to produce and disseminate them. The production process for statistical outputs has certain similarities to the traditional production model from economics, and this analogy might be useful for identifying the salient dimensions of a statistical capacity measure. The production process begins with a technology that is used in generating the statistical products, and the level of this technology is clearly a relevant component of statistical capacity. The resulting statistical outputs might be divided into two general categories. First are the intermediate products, which have direct use for specialists but require additional processing to create products suitable for general use. For example, a census can be helpful for policy analysts but must be processed to obtain useful statistics. Second are the final products, which are available in a form that can be understood by the public. The key macro statistics of a country would naturally be viewed as final products. Even after the products have been created, their existence does not imply that potential users will actually have access to them. Statistical products may be available to only a few users, or available to all. The final dimension then covers the extent to which statistical products are disseminated.
This simple framework helps to identify four coherent dimensions for a measure of statistical capacity, namely: (i) Methodology, Standards and Classifications (MSC), which provides information on the technology being used by the NSS; (ii) Census and Surveys (CS), which describes the intermediate products of the NSS; (iii) Availability of Key Indicators (AKI), which focuses on key final products needed for policy; and (iv) Dissemination Practices and Openness (DPO), which evaluates the extent to which products are publicly disseminated. It is easy to see that each of these dimensions is centrally related to the statistical capacity of an NSS.
