It is an integral part of the SNA1993 and more detailed subdivision of the classes provide comparability between countries and between statistics in these different areas.                                                                                                                                                                            |

It classifies jobs with respect to the type of explicit or implicit contract of employment between the job holder and the economic unit in which he or she is employed.  Therefore, it aims to provide the basis for production of internationally comparable statistics on the employment relationship, including the distinction between salaried employment and self-employment.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
