# Statistical Performance Index & Indicators


## How to use this tool
The Statistical Performance Index (SPI) framework is designed to capture different aspects of national
statistical capacity by employing most relevant and representative
variables that are publicly available. The SPI can be used to gauge
statistical performance of individual countries over time or
cross-country comparisons of performance at a point in time.

This application allows users to explore the Statistical Performance Index and the indicators that populate it.  

The first tab in the application, Overall SPI, shows a map of the overall index score, along with scores of the four primary dimensions: Methodology, Standards & Classifications (MSC), Censuses and Surveys (CS), Availability of Key Indicators (AKI), and Dissemination Practices & Openness (DPO).

Additionally, the user can explore each dimension in detail by clicking on the respective tab.  Within each dimension tab, for instance the Methodology, Standards & Classifications (MSC), the user can explore the indicators that make up this dimension, such as the system of national accounts in use or the score on the compilation of government finance statistics.  More metadata information is available in these tabs as well.

## What is the Statistical Performance Index?

<!-- /MDTOC -->
The SPI aims to provide an objective, justifiable/verifiable assessment
of the statistical performance of countries over time by using publicly
available information from international agencies and country websites
that were produced by national statistical systems. The SPI framework
helps countries and development partners identify the strengths and
weaknesses of national statistical systems and areas of potential
improvements. It could also provide actionable guidance for national
statistical systems in areas that may require further and deeper
assessment. Key characteristics of the SPI are:

  - Uses only publicly accessible data  
  - Transparent methodology  
  - Easily replicable  
  - Provides a long-time series to track progress in performance  
  - Captures outcomes and supporting elements  
  - Reflects the SDGs.  
  - Facilitates at-a-glance comparisons on a global scale

A recent paper by Cameron et al.Â (2019) provides the conceptual
foundation for SPI in measuring the ability of NSS to produce high
quality data to inform national and international policy decisions
