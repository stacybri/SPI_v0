Statistical Performance Index 
================


## Statistical Performance Index Overview

The SPI framework is designed to capture different aspects of national
statistical capacity by employing most relevant and representative
variables that are publicly available. The SPI can be used to gauge
statistical performance of individual countries over time or
cross-country comparisons of performance at a point in time.

The SPI aims to provide an objective, justifiable/verifiable assessment
of the statistical performance of countries over time by using publicly
available information from international agencies and country websites
that were produced by national statistical systems. The SPI framework
helps countries and development partners identify the strengths and
weaknesses of national statistical systems and areas of potential
improvements. It could also provide actionable guidance for national
statistical systems in areas that may require further and deeper
assessment. Key characteristics of the SPI are:

  - Uses only publicly accessible data  
  - Transparent methodology  
  - Easily replicable  
  - Provides a long-time series to track progress in performance  
  - Captures outcomes and supporting elements  
  - Reflects the SDGs.  
  - Facilitates at-a-glance comparisons on a global scale

A recent paper by Cameron et al. (2019) provides the conceptual
foundation for SPI in measuring the ability of NSS to produce high
quality data to inform national and international policy decisions

## Availability of Key Indicators (AKI) Overview

Transforming source data into statistical outputs (indicators) and
releasing them on a timely basis shows that the statistical systems are
utilizing their capacity in data production. Reporting relevant data to
specialized international agencies on time and getting them published in
their respective databases demonstrates that statistical systems meet
required quality standards and timeliness. Therefore, this dimension
evaluates national statistical systems by reviewing the availability of
country data for the most recent year in international databases. By
looking at the data availability in international databases, it also
makes the assessment cost-effective.

The selection of the indicators under the AKI dimension is based on the
following principles:

  - It should provide some assessment of national statistical
    performance, i.e. the indicators should be produced by countries;  
  - The availability of indicators should be verifiable, with
    established standards and methodologies in producing the
    statistics.  
  - It should help address the development concerns of countries,
    especially with SDGs. Nine indicators included in this category
    overlap to large extent with the Tier 1 SDG list that are
    conceptually clear, established methodology and standards are
    available and data regularly produced by countries;

These selected indicators cover key socio-economic and SDG indicators
that have well established standards and methodology in the area of
poverty, health, education, and economic development. It is assumed that
if national statistical systems have capacity in the first two
dimensions they should be able to produce these selected indicators.

# Initial Set of Indicators

The initial proposal for the AKI is below. The way the AKI index is
scored is that countries are given a value of ‘1’ if the indicator is
available for the country and ‘0’ otherwise. The total AKI score for the
country is then the

This headcount ratio is a key statistic for national development plans, is relevant for all LICs and MICs, is expected to be compiled periodically in the future, and reflects an NSO’s capability of conducting a household survey. The World Bank is the primary compiler of these headcount rates, so using our own databases makes sense. One challenge is that the series from the WDI the SPI uses (SI.POV.NAHC) only contains elements if the national poverty rates are comparable. If there is a break in the series, not all national poverty rates will be shown. An alternative is to use the SI.POV.NAHC.NC indicator from the Poverty and Equity database (<https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/poverty-and-equity-database>), which also contains national poverty estimates even when there is a break in the series. |
