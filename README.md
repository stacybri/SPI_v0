# SPI_AKI
Shiny application useful for SPI AKI work

DECIS has been tasked with coming up with a set of roughly 12 indicators for the Availability of Key Indicators (AKI) dimension of the Statistical Performance Index (SPI).  Based on feedback from the concept note of the SPI, the SPI team has requested the indicators for the AKI:
	Cover  the SDGs as well as possible (for instance, in the current set of indicators below there is no coverage of environmental SDGs).  Tier 1 SDG indicators are preferred
	The indicators must be (as much as possible) produced by the country statistical systems, so as to measure statistical capacity.  Not modelled estimates.
	Included in the WDI.

The set of 12 indicators needs to be delivered within a 2-3 week time span.  How we selected these indicators should be simple/straightforward and justifiable.  

In order to accomplish this, in the near term, we will need subject matter experts to provide 3-5 indicators that fit the above criteria for each subject matter domain.  Again, the indicators suggested for each subject matter area should be: highly relevant indicators, included in the WDI, and indicators that the country statistical systems produce.  Ideally, we will then have a list of 20-25 indicators as a first draft list.  Then we will cull this list to roughly 12 indicators, which will be the final set for the SPI.
